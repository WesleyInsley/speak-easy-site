Sample website for a NYC based speakeasy. Built mobile first, and I will continue to build onto it so that it fits well on all screens. (It fits well as is, but could have a better UX).

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REAL BUSINESS. Merely a proof of concept. If you go to the Comedy Cellar and ask to go here, you will get laughed at. Sorry.

Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript (React.js)
